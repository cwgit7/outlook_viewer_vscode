# Publishing Guide for Outlook MSG Preview Extension

This guide will walk you through the process of publishing your VS Code extension to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

## Prerequisites

Before you can publish your extension, you need:

1. **Microsoft Account** - A free Microsoft account
2. **Publisher Account** - Created on the Visual Studio Marketplace
3. **Personal Access Token** - For authentication during publishing

## Step 1: Create a Publisher Account

1. Go to [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage)
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account
3. Click "Create a publisher"
4. Fill in the required information:
   - **Publisher ID**: Choose a unique identifier (e.g., `yourname`, `yourcompany`)
   - **Display Name**: Your name or organization name
   - **Email**: Your email address
   - **Website** (optional): Your website URL

**Important**: The Publisher ID must be unique across the entire marketplace. If your first choice is taken, try variations like `yourname-dev`, `yourname-extensions`, etc.

## Step 2: Generate Personal Access Token

1. Go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com)
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account
3. Click on your profile picture â†’ "Security"

   - **Expiration**: Choose appropriate duration (recommend 1 year)
   - **Scopes**: Custom defined
   - **Marketplace**: Publish (check this box)
7. Click "Create"
8. **Copy the token immediately** - you won't be able to see it again!

## Step 3: Update Your Extension Configuration

### Update package.json

Replace the placeholder values in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "outlook-msg-preview",
  "displayName": "Outlook MSG Preview",
  "description": "Preview Outlook .msg files directly in VS Code",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "publisher": "your-actual-publisher-id",

    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/outlook-msg-preview.git"

  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/outlook-msg-preview/issues"
  },
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

### Create a LICENSE file

Create a `LICENSE` file in your project root:

   ```

2. Go to [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage)

4. Choose "Visual Studio Code"
5. Upload your `.vsix` file
6. Fill in the extension details:
   - **Extension name**: Outlook MSG Preview
   - **Description**: Brief description of what your extension does
   - **Category**: Choose "Other" or "Formatters"
   - **Tags**: Add relevant tags like "outlook", "msg", "email", "preview"

   {
     "version": "0.0.2"
   }
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and test thoroughly

3. **Publish the update**:
